# Protohackers

The [Protohackers](https://protohackers.com/) problems in Elixir!

Huge thanks to Andrea Leopardi for introducing me to this set of challenges
with his [introductory video on how to write the smoke test in
Elixir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owz50_NYIZ8)

I've (re)organized the problems into an umbrella app so each problem has its own
application in the umbrella structure.

You can run all of the servers at once locally

```
$ mix deps.get
$ mix run --no-halt
```
