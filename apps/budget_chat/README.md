# BudgetChat

[Protohackers 3: Budget Chat](https://protohackers.com/problem/3) solved in
Elixir

## Usage

Run the BudgetChat server e.g. `mix run --no-halt`

While the server is running you can telnet to the server port to start an
interactive chat session. After being prompted for a name you will join the chat
room and anything you type will be sent as a message.

Use multiple telnet sessions to get the actual chat experience.

```
telnet localhost 11238
```
